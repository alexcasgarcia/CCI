What is the difference between a tuple and a list?
 - List is mutable
 - Tuple is immutable
 - Why does this matter?
   - memory usage when trying to append an item
   - when you create a variable, some fixed memory is assigned to the variable.
   - If it is a list more memory is assigned than actually used
 - Tuples are heterogeneous data structures (their entries have different meanings)
 - Lists are homogeneous sequences
 - Tuples have structure, lists have order


What is the cost of a list append?

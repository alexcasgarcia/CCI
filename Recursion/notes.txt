1.Hopping Problem
 - You don't need the extra case for n==2 or n==1.
 - Just need n<0, n==0, and an else
 - Number of ways overflows for large values of n? Maybe in Java, I don't see this in python.

2.Robot in a Grid
 - use MyGrid[r][c] as it is more explicit that [x][y].  r and c refer to row and column while x and y could be relative to left side or right side or top or bottom.
 - the books approach was different, tried to hit all possible paths
 - None object used in python instead of null.  "if x is None:" only works if you wrote x = None earlier. This works if you want to check if it is undefined:

try:
	thevariable
except NameError:
	print "thevariable is not defined"
else:
	print "the variable was defined"
